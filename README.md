# Deployed Super Mario on Kubernetes Using Terraform ðŸŽ®

## Purpose:
This project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in cloud deployment and Kubernetes orchestration while deploying a classic application like Super Mario. It showcases the ability to automate infrastructure setup and management using Terraform on AWS.

## Features and Tools Used:

- **Infrastructure Automation:** Utilized Terraform for automating the setup of Kubernetes infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability.

- **AWS Services:** Deployed on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for efficient container orchestration and management.

- **Deployment Process:** Configured deployment and service files to host and run Super Mario seamlessly on Kubernetes.

- **Cleanup Automation:** Implemented a cleanup process to securely delete all deployed resources post-project, optimizing AWS cost management.

### Steps Used:

- **Environment Setup:** Installed Docker, Terraform, AWS CLI, and kubectl to set up the development and deployment environment.
- **IAM Role Configuration:** Created and configured IAM roles to manage secure access permissions for AWS resources.
- **Infrastructure Deployment:** Automated the deployment of Kubernetes infrastructure using Terraform scripts.
- **Application Deployment:** Configured and deployed Super Mario application on Amazon EKS using Kubernetes deployment and service files.
- **Infrastructure Cleanup:** Implemented automated cleanup procedures to delete all deployed resources after completing the project.
